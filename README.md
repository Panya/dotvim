# Intro to VIM

Here's some tips if you've never used VIM before:

## Tutorials

* Type `vimtutor` into a shell to go through a brief interactive
  tutorial inside VIM.
* Read the slides at [VIM: Walking Without Crutches](http://walking-without-crutches.heroku.com/#1).

## Modes

* VIM has two modes:
  * insert mode- stuff you type is added to the buffer
  * normal mode- keys you hit are interpretted as commands
* To enter insert mode, hit `i`
* To exit insert mode, hit `<ESC>`

## Useful commands

* Use `:q` to exit vim
* `,W` to remove trail whitespaces
* `gcc` to comment/uncomment
* `,t` to CtrlP (like TextMate Command-T)
* Keyboard [cheat sheet](http://walking-without-crutches.heroku.com/image/images/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.png).
